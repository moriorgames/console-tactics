Console tactics FP
==================

Console tactics is a First Person Like game, based on old games like Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993).

I've read some theory about that games and I've found it really interesting to I decided to start a project to do some experiments with C++, Object Oriented programming and a Graphic Library. 

I use this project to do some practices about Design Patterns and to enjoy building something useless but fun :)


# How to run the program

I will create a Docker image to be able to run this program on any computer. Now I'm finishing to configure the SFML library on it
